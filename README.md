# Blinkit Analysis Project using PowerBI

## Introduction
This project dives into:

✅ Sales distribution by item type, outlet size, and location

✅ Trends in outlet establishment over time

✅ Customer behavior segmented by fat content and outlet tier

✅ Comparative performance of outlet types based on visibility, ratings, and average sales

My goal was to build a clear, interactive, and insight-rich report that helps stakeholders quickly identify what’s working and where optimizations are needed.

## Tools & Techniques Used:

✅ Power BI for data visualization

✅ DAX for calculated measures

✅ Interactive filtering and user-centric design

✅ KPI Cards, Bar Charts, Donut Charts, Line Graphs & Matrix

## Takeways:
This dashboard not only reflects the sales dynamics across regions and outlet types but also helps decision-makers identify high-performing outlet segments, understand customer preferences, and improve inventory and outlet planning strategies.
